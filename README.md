A .vim directory
================

This repository bundles all of my efforts to get a functional modern vim configuration.

It includes all configurations which have cumulated over time as well exploitations of recent vim package distributions.

Best used with MacVim.

Included niceties
-----------------
We use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) for plugin management. Get it with

    cd $HOME
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    vim +PluginInstall +qall


Unincluded niceties
-------------------
The repository does not bundle eclim but it seems to be compatible.
